# linux-hunter
Prototype MH:W companion app for Linux, inspired by SmartHunter

## Status
Current code/logic is highly prototype and not working on any 3rd party - please refrain from using it, or use it at your own risk

## Root access
Unforutnately looks like CAPCOM and/or wine/Proton are protecting memory, hence this requires `sudo` access when running
